There are a total of 9 different sprites. Each sprite has four different positions: masked, folded, reaching, and
unmasked. Masked is with arms to their sides with a mask on. Folded is with their arms folded forward (making them
look shorter), with their masks on. Reaching is with their arms aimed toward their equipped masks. Unmasked is with
their arms to their sides without a mask on. Using the sprites in that order should give the appearance of the sprites
taking off their masks.
