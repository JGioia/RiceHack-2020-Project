This is more a description of how main works because main.py does not contain any classes.

main creates the window, loads all of the images that will need to be used into memory, and then runs the main function.
The main function sets the level counter, fps, creates the menu object, creates the level object, and keeps track of
which scene we are on. Every tick main checks if the player lost the level, tells the level and menu objects what scene
we are on, tells if an object has been clicked on, and calls redraw_window. redraw_window gets all of the sprites, their
position, size, and visibility from the level and menu objects and draws them at the appropriate locations.

We will have to update all of the method names that we referred to with what they actually are going to be.
